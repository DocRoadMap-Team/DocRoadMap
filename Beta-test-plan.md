## 1. Context

DocRoadMap is a solution that includes a mobile app and a web extension, both designed to be user-friendly, straightforward, and intuitive. To ensure reliability, all data is sourced exclusively from government sources. You can use the mobile app and the web extension either separately or together to fully benefit from the solution.

### Why offer both a web extension and a mobile application?

The two tools are complementary and meet distinct but often simultaneous uses:

- Generally, users handle their administrative tasks on a computer through official government websites. Our web extension seamlessly integrates into these sites to assist them, so users donâ€™t have to switch pages or open a new site. Our solution is available right where they are completing their tasks.
- Keeping track of tasks, managing reminders, and quickly accessing information anytime (even while on the go) is easy with the mobile app.

### Our solution also includes:

- A list of guides for the various situations and processes they may encounter as they start their professional journey.
- Reminders of critical dates and integrated calendar for an overview.
- A multilingual interface (French, English, Spanish for the moment)
- Two unique chatbots
- An extension that allows users to modify certain accessibility criteria (WCAG and RGAA) on an active web page.
- Plus additional features that we will explain later in the document.

The guide should be visual, interactive, and detailed, helping users step by step through all their processes. It will be tailored to both business needs and personal situations through a series of questions and answers.

One of the chatbots will be available to assist users with any questions they have about the steps in the process or to clarify any confusion regarding the procedures. If a step is missing, users will be able to provide that information to add it.

The current phase marks the transition to the beta version, where the goal is to test and validate the key features mentioned earlier before a wider rollout that focuses on user feedback.

- Gathering the right sources of knowledge is essential, depending on how we set up our RAG, to ensure that our AI can provide the most suitable responses.

### â™¿ Accessibility:

- Our information is still incomplete regarding the implementation of accessibility solutions, such as the use of error detection software and AI to improve ALT text for images on websites.

# üì¶ Installation of the Application via an APK File

---

## 1. Introduction

The **APK** (Android Package Kit) file allows you to install an Android app manually, without using the Google Play Store. This method is commonly used to test a beta version or distribute an app outside of the conventional channels.

It is ideal for testing, internal demos, or a gradual launch with a limited group.

## 2. Getting Started

### 1. Allow Unknown Sources

Before installing an APK file, your phone must be allowed to install apps from sources other than the Play Store.

1. Open **Settings > Security** (or **Privacy**, depending on your device).
2. Enable **Unknown Sources** or **Install Unknown Apps**.
3. If prompted, allow this permission only for the app you are using (e.g., Chrome, Gmail, or your file manager).

> üîê *This permission is required only once. You can disable it after installation.*

## 3. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Installation blocked**: Make sure that unknown sources are enabled for the app you're using.  
2. **"App not installed" message**: Uninstall any previous version of the app first.  
3. **Download not working**: Try using a different browser or check your internet connection.  
4. **Contact a team member**: Send a private message via Discord or Instagram to inform us of any issues.

## 4. Security

- Ensure that the APK file comes from a **trusted source**, such as an administrator member of the DocRoadMap group or the beta server.  
- Avoid APKs from other individuals, as downloading APKs from third-party sources can be risky.  
- Do not share your APK if it contains personal or sensitive data.

## 5. Conclusion

Installing an APK is a simple, fast, and effective method to test or use DocRoadMap outside of the Play Store. It offers great flexibility in distribution, particularly for beta versions or user testing of the project.
